### Project Title

Examining how the social brain re-configures during an emotion recognition task

### Brief Project Description

Examine changes in modularity and flexibility from baseline through an emotion recognition task in a cross-sectional sample from childhood through young adulthood. This project will take two approaches to identifying the social brain: (1) seed-based using personalized networks and (2) based on a literature of the putative social brain. Modularity and flexibility changes over the course of these two task sessions are the primary outcome of interest.

### Code documentation

This section is the bulk of the project page, and can be broken up as best fits the project.  Remember that this should be acessible prose that allows your replicator, reviewer, or interested reader to step through your code and understand how the code corresponds to the findings described in the paper. At a minimum, there should be clear documentation regarding sample selection (e.g., inclusion/exclusion), preprocessing (e.g., container version, data freeze), and hypothesis testing (usually in the form of an analytic notebook).   See the [Project Reproducibility  Guide](https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/LabHome/ReproSystem/) for more information.
